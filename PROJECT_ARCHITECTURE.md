# Web Project Template - Architecture Foundation

This document provides an overview of the web project template architecture, serving as an index to the more detailed documentation files and a foundation for creating diverse website templates.

## Project Overview

This web project template is a full-stack application framework that can be adapted to various website concepts. Originally designed as a Charity Information Website, the architecture has been generalized to serve as a foundation for different types of websites. The template consists of a React frontend and a Node.js/Express backend with MongoDB for data storage.
